This is an asyncio bot for monitoring repos. Right now, the bot is setup as me. In the future the bot should be the ascbot.

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables need to be set in order for this bot to operate:

- GH_AUTH: This is the authentication token for the user/bot that is going to be interacting with the GitHub API.
- GH_SECRET: This is the secret for the repo that is generated when the webhook is created.
